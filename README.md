 Scripts for use with [Batch Image Manipulation Plug In GIMP](https://alessandrofrancesconi.it/projects/bimp/)

## Auto Filters
 The folder [AutoFilters](/AutoFilters/) contains multiple scropts which allow to apply internal GIMP filters to images with random parameters

 **Cubist** replaces original image with a set of squares with random directyion and less detailes color representation. Somewhat similar to pixellization, but each square had it's own color gradient. Results are not repeatable, no logs are written. ![An example of the work of the script is below](/CubistExample.jpg) The script was applied two separate times on the far left lines.

 **Mosaic** replaces the original image with a broken pattern triangulars. Results are not repeatable, no logs are written. ![An example of the work of the script is below](/MosaicExcample.jpg) The script was applied two separate times on the far left lines.

 **Oilify** replaces the original image with an more smudged image, resempling opl painting. Results are not repeatable, no logs are written. ![An example of the work of the script is below](/OilifyExample.jpg) The script was applied two separate times on the far left lines.
